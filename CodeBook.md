# CodeBook

## Variables Description

Variable      | Description
------------- | -------------
subject   | Subject ID # 
activity   | Activity ID

All other variables are a combination of the following:

- "time" or "frequency" - data collected in the time or frequency domain
- "Body" or "Gravity
- "Acc", "AccJerk", "Gyro", "GyroJerk", "AccMag", "AccJerkMag", "GyroMag", or "GyroJerkMag"
- "mean()" or "std()"

Each row is the mean value of these variables across a much larger data set, per subject, per activity

## Data Description

Descriptions are available in the "features_info.txt" file in the root level of the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.

## Description of Pre-processing/Transformations

This data set were generated by generally following the steps below:

1. For the training data set
- Cbinding the actual data (X_train) with the subject IDs (subject_train) and the activity factors (y_train)
- Assigning the features (features.txt) to the column headings of that data set
2. Repeating the steps above for the test data set
3. Combining the two data sets above
4. Excerpting only the variables that contained mean() or std() information
5. Assigning meaningful activity labels (activity_labels.txt) to the activity factors column
6. Revising some of the column headings
7. Creating a tidy data set that would average, for each activity type within each subject, each column heading/variable
8. Exporting the tidy data set into a text file
